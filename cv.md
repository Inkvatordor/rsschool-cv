###About me
I want to become professional developer with a big amount of knowledge. But i should start from something, and find a job where i can get great expirience. I enjoy explore new tecnologies and fight throught hard learning if i can't get something. 

The only PL i can say i know is JS. But also i tried PHP, 1C, Python, Rust, C#.
In JS i mostly used Vue.js framework but i prefer to use clear HTML CSS JS for my projects because they have no sense if the app is small. I use Node.JS to create utilities i need. Utilities was the reason why i tried C# and Rust, but i think it has no sense to spend time on them if i don't need them in near future(but i sure must learn them later), when i can do it on Node.JS in much less time. I use puppeteer to parse websites and display the information in my apps. Right now i work for comics parser so i could have better reading expirience with better interfaces i made on Electron. For styles i use SASS preprocessor.

I cant say i'm good at it, because, as i said for Vue, there no much need of it in small projects where you work alone. Most of the time i use add-commit-push combination, but i know how important this in a big project, so slowly(because i can't really practice it) i learning it.

I learned BEM methology when was doing test tasks for "SibDev".

As code editor i use VS Code. It has easy to use GUI and everything already built in.
I used linux for a while, so i do understand way how do you work on it. Also i run local FTP and dev website servers on ubuntu server machine.

####English Skills
I can watch YouTube videos with english without having problems and missunderstnadings. Also i chat with people around the world almost everyday, so i hope i'm good enough to work. I just need to learn more words to speak more freely.
